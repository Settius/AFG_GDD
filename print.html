<p>Although presented as all bad cultists from the start, there are actually 3+ unique types of cultists in their own areas and agenda’s which you discover as you progress.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>“The Forgotten Children”</strong> Protective magic focused on purity of mind and soul. Believe in welcoming all to their church. Believe working in a group to pool resources will open doors control greater rituals and magic that can save the town</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Led by secretive but powerful Chosen Sear building a wizard army</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They secretly involve many in the town and visiting Healers gift the community with food and healing</p>
<ul>
<li>Healing comes at a cost of mind and soul with the “healed” often drained physically but cured of their previous ailments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base their believes on lost scrolls and manuscripts found within the shrines and history of Ankhoron,</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Angels of Ankhoron were the perfection of humanity, leading the fate of humans against a force of dragons and leviathans”</li>
<li>“They were perfect in their ways, and rose above mortals as ascended on wings of light. They were the hand of Justice, and dedicated their lives to seeking out and purging the evil in the world.”</li>
<li>“But their reign was not to last and their numbers dwindled as 1000 year war tore the continent apart.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is rumored the blood of angels lives on in certain people. The Great Sear is trying to purify this essence and regain wield to power of the Angels to fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plot Progression/Twist</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As you defeat their forces in the sewers/mines and nearby, you find not all are human and many are ratmen or plagued zombies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you close in on their hideout underground they decide to perform their final ritual to ascend the Great Sear to become an Angel</p>
<ul>
<li>The town alchemist, a friends and questgiver, turns out to be a cult supporter and dies as sacrifice to the Great Sear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great sear creates not an angel but a 3headed demon comprised of the Sear, Alchemist, and cult leader. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monster is incredibly powerful and near invincible, and you defeat them by pushing them down a great chasm leading deep into earth</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Sisters of Witchlake”</strong> Organized undead army of necromancers who lead raiding parties and put up traps to hunt humans and living in the area</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seem to be building a growing army of necromancers in the lands around town</p>
<ul>
<li>They control most of the forests and graveyards</li>
<li>And they raid the farms to destroy what little food we can grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Led by dead soldiers and farmers a like, they have made a mission of corrupting all the graves in the wartorn valley and creating a new undead army to take the town</p>
<ul>
<li>Although their undead champion are strong, we know they cannot be defeated and will rise again until someone can take out the necromancer Witches that live in the center of the lake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are the protectors of the Bishop King that once ruled the Fortress to the North</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be required to cross their lands in order to reach the Fortress and the monastery where they train new witches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plot Twist</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>As you defeat their hideout you realize you are not fighting undead but human spellcasters that control the undead. The undead are limited in their intelligence but have been revived to protect the human Sisters that remain
<ul>
<li>Once a large successful family, after the wars the men had all died on the battlefield leaving little to defend themselves</li>
<li>The family gathered their resources and some Sisters once healers of light, turned to darkness and raised an army of undead to protect the few that remain and gather food from farms</li>
<li>Their champions are actually fallen family, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers that once died to protect their family, now continue their fight as undead champions</li>
<li>They</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Nameless Devourer”</strong> A secretive dark society of mages and necromancers that have resorted to forbidden magic. Also known as the Servants as all are devoted to serving the Devourer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Magic has many schools in Ankhoron, there are darker magics but the only magics that are banned are the Abyssal magics</p>
<ul>
<li>Magics that require sacrificing living creatures or human blood are frowned upon</li>
<li>But Abyssal magics generally require devotion of mind, body, and soul to dark demons. These magicks are known to be powerful but temporary.
<ul>
<li>Practitioners deform their bodies becoming more demonic with each use of their powers, and eventually end up losing control of their body and become a full outright demon</li>
<li>Only the hopeless and homeless resort to such magics. The Dark Lords of the Devourer often seek out the weak or dieing who may, as a last resort or in a fit of revenge, sell their soul to serve eternity as a demon rather than die as a beggar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Devourers first weapon of choice is generally the Ashen Plague</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An ancient plague created by dark magic to weaken and corrupt all living things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spread by the secret cultists, they summon plague and darkness wherever they go to corrupt the crops and weak people</p>
<ul>
<li>The first sign is often the smells and corruption in the sewers and caves nearby where they spread their dark rituals and plague shrines</li>
<li>Another sign is often the devouring mimics. Large - spiderlike creatures that protect the dark spells that feed the plague</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These dark Shrines corrupt the universe itself and will bring even the greatest kingdoms to their knees as famine, drought, entropy, and endless bad luck destroy all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only when their prey is sufficiently weak do they march with their great monstrous armies of undead and demons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their empire grows endlessly to the North</li>
<li>Each year acquiring new territory</li>
<li>Although Ashridge won the Dark War, they are losing the town, and it is only a matter of time before they invade again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plot Progression</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defeat of the Devourer Cultist requires discovery and cleaning out all the evil shrines in the area</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimic layers, trapped shrines, and hidden magic is everywhere</li>
<li>Devourers can corrupt anyone and anything. They have cultists humans, demons, ratmen, undead, and dark champions to defend their shrines</li>
<li>Early quests involve clearing the sewers of Dark Shrines guarded</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually the source of the plague will lead you upstream to the Monastery Fortress where the Bishop King and the monk of monastery must be defeated as their corruption runs the deepest</p>
<ul>
<li>Defeat of them will bring you to the original roots and deep catacombs which lead back to the Great Mines of beneath the city</li>

<h3 id="ancient-ratmen-questline--the-survivors-of-the-dark-age"><a class="header" href="#ancient-ratmen-questline--the-survivors-of-the-dark-age">“Ancient Ratmen” Questline – The survivors of the Dark Age</a></h3>
<p>Most think of the Ratmen as mutated rats that escaped a mad wizards experiment. But their roots run deeper than this. They are the survivors of a darker age over 1000 years ago. Once human, they are the ancestors of men who once lived with the Dragons and Leviathons of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Driven underground by the monsters in the air and in the sea, the learned to build civilizations underground and discovered the first magics </p>
<ul>
<li>Now this lives on as Shamanistic magic and Blood Magics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the age of Dragons ended, they saw a new age of exploration and began to meet the new people from far away and build cities above ground</p>
<ul>
<li>But then came the Angelic Crusades that wiped out many civilizations under 1000 years of war</li>
<li>Those lucky enough locked themselves deep in the caves below where the humans feared to follow</li>
<li>But the Crusader kings were not kind, and they waged a war of poisons, magical plagues, and endless disease onto those below and locking the gates to cities below as they those below to die </li>
<li>Through 1000 years, they survived, but barely as they learned to adapt by magical mutations (perhaps aided by the plague) to evolve resistance to poison, plagues, and Disease</li>
<li>With this they created great mutants like the Great Mole Giants that can dig through stone and vicious Nightmare Guards gifted with amazing speed and dexterity
<ul>
<li>To enhance their numbers they evolved rats into giant rats vermin to bolster their number and further their cause</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually they were ready and they waged a war on the Angels</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sneaking from the sewers they created the magebane weapons and giant champions to defeat the Crusading Kings</p>
<ul>
<li>Once great armies with fortresses able to withstand dragons</li>
<li>The Kings instead fell to a overwhelming force from below as the Ratmen rose to exact revenge on those that had trapped them a millenia</li>
<li>And as quickly as they came, they took their treasure and went back to their underground cities where they were more comfortable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people that remained learned their lesson and feared the wrath of the demon rats with red eyes, blood magic, and tails of destruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quickly people sealed their sewers with great gates, closed their mines and vowed never to let the demons rise again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in time this was forgotten. The keys to the gates were lots.</p>
<ul>
<li>But hate for rats and ratmen ran deep, and few cities left their sewers unguarded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Ashridge, the Ratmen are some of the most common enemies</p>
<ul>
<li>They live in the sewers, the forests, the mines and the caves</li>
<li>Most are just ratmen trying to scrape together a living and may have some Shamanistic magic</li>
<li>The true Ratmen live deep below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plot Progression and role</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secretive in their movements, they are well adapted and smaller ratmen are able to bypass the Great Gates that block the tunnels into the Abyss</p>
<ul>
<li>They can talk and trade and some have actively traded with humans for a millenia with the shady dealers willing to work with the unseen below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early on corrupted Ratmen are common near the Dark Shrines</p>
<ul>
<li>Ratmen Bosses and Champions will protect the larger shrines will often work with other corrupted cultists (identified by possessed white eyes)</li>
<li>Scar the Ravager is a corrupted Nightmare rat</li>
<li>Fatrat the King – is a fat corrupted Molerat that leads the sewer colonies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along he journey, the player will often encounter tips and whispers from the Ratmen that follow him</p>
<ul>
<li>These will become dark allies that guide you unknowingly through the tunnels and supply you with food, water, and healing like a guardian angel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancient Druids</strong> - Going deeper into the Mines, Forests, and Abyss will encounter the Ancients Druids, the last of the Ancient Ratmen who live on near the surface</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many of the Forests and cavescontrol areas controlled by treants and the Druids</p>
<ul>
<li>They will definitely be encountered as a faction neither cultist nor undead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Druidic magic is neither good nor evil by itself. They are the masters of natural magic that controls life and death</p>
<ul>
<li>They look as druids do, generally human but unusually close with nature taking on aspects of their natural affinity whether it be rats or trees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those that stray too far from the way of the Ancient Druids are known generally as Dark Druids who prefer to spread disease and rot</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as humans, there are good and evil Druids among their society who are shunned by the Ancient Druids</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Druids often retain the ability to shapeshift into trees, ratmen, and other monsters such as Mimics</p>
<ul>
<li>True druids study all the natural forms but generally can only master one or 2 alternate forms, the rest are at best imitations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Druids will hinder and help you along your quests</p>
<ul>
<li>Side quests will allow you to pass dangerous Dark Druid lands as long as you ally yourself with the Ancient Druids</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abyssal Ratmen</strong> – they will not be encountered but its known not long after the Angelic Crusades, they disappeared with their gold and captives</p>
<ul>
<li>Few ventured that deep but corruption and Devourer cultists seem more common below and above ground</li>
<li>Its hinted the cities still survive but with few details of exactly what or where</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goshilos (Hungry dead)</strong> are corpses that have been reanimated by the magical storm which has covered the wasteland. Some of these corpses were simply animated as they were while others died with more of the storm in their bloodstream and were completely overtaken by its power. The souls of the Goshilos are trapped within their rotting forms, aware but unable to do anything but submit to the will of the magic that animates them. All they know is an endless hunger and a relentless will to destroy anything not like them. Unless they are stopped they will spread their poison out of the wasteland and across the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jotas (Virals) “The Sickness”</strong> These corpses laid still in their graves until the storm came and summoned them up from the ground. As the howling winds crossed the land it was joined by the moans and rattling breath of these hungry ghouls. The people of the wasteland saw to their horror that it was not just fresh bodies which rose, but older corpses which should have been little more than dust and bone. The magic of the storm gave them flesh again, and enough of a mind to find the living and devour them. They may be little more than puppets, but they know enough to find their prey and wield simple weapons against them. Since their bodies are held together by the storm itself, fire is best to keep them from rising again. Even the tiniest piece may soon grow back into another Jota.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duersos (Leapers) “The Starving”</strong> Many Goshilos were alive when the storm hit and some died in the process of wondrous transformations. The most numerous of these are The Starving. The storm gave them great speed and agility, and razor sharp claws to tear the living apart. Once they had received these great powers they died almost instantly, starving to death trying to feed their new abilities. They returned from death just as hungry as when they crossed over. They are much faster than Jotas and will immediately attack anyone that gets close enough to them. While they are faster and more deadly than their lesser counterparts, they will quickly starve if not fed a steady diet of living flesh, but even the smallest amount of blood will send them scrambling for more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apoyas (Toads) “The Vile”</strong> Water is scarce in the wasteland, and what is left as become a toxic, chemical stew that has bubbled to the surface in stagnant, stinky pools, overflowing onto the sand and soaking it in poisonous muck. Anyone that died in these pools has been transformed in their resurrection into Apoyas. Mostly content to sit and eat those that walk by, the apoyas have a long, barbed tongue which can pump the victim full of the toxic sludge that bloats their body. Once the victim has been immobilized by the poison, the Apoya is free to eat. They crawl on their victim and begin to suck the liquifying insides out of the body through their tongues. Sometimes they may eat more than their distended bodies can hold and will burst, spreading their poison far in the process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Undeza (Goons) “The Many”</strong> Some who died in the storm died in the process of transforming into great beasts, and when they grew, anyone around them was absorbed into their new body, drowning in the flesh of the newly created Undeza. The flesh of these monsters is constantly roiling as limbs press outward, trying to escape their imprisonment inside. The Undeza are the least hungry of all Goshilos, however, they are filled with a hatred that cannot be sated. They will kill without eating, and tear their victims apart for the joy of it. Rumors abound that some Undeza speak, and may even have thoughts… Any who face them may soon be added to the multitude within, where they will beg for release for the entirety of their death.</p>

<p>A preprocessor for <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook">mdbook</a> to add <a href="https://material.io/design">Material Design</a> admonishments, based on the <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/">mkdocs-material</a> implementation.</p>
<p>It turns this:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish info
A beautifully styled message.
```
</code></pre>
<p>into this:</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Info</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A beautifully styled message.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="usage"><a class="header" href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Use any <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code-block</a> as you normally would, but annotate it with <code>admonish &lt;admonition type&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish example
My example is the best!
```
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Example</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My example is the best!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>See the <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#supported-types">mkdocs-material docs</a> for a list of supported admonitions. You'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>info</code></li>
<li><code>warning</code></li>
<li><code>danger</code></li>
<li><code>example</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and quite a few more!</p>
<p>You can also leave out the admonition type altogether, in which case it will default to <code>note</code>:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish
A plain note.
```
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition note">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Note</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A plain note.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="additional-options"><a class="header" href="#additional-options">Additional Options</a></h3>
<h4 id="custom-title"><a class="header" href="#custom-title">Custom title</a></h4>
<p>A custom title can be provided, contained in a double quoted JSON string.
Note that JSON escapes must be escaped again - for instance, write <code>\&quot;</code> as <code>\\&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>```admonish warning &quot;Data loss&quot;
The following steps can lead to irrecoverable data corruption.
```
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Data loss</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The following steps can lead to irrecoverable data corruption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can also remove the title bar entirely, by specifying the empty string:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish success &quot;&quot;
This will take a while, go and grab a drink of water.
```
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition success">
<div>
<p>This will take a while, go and grab a drink of water.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="nested-markdownhtml"><a class="header" href="#nested-markdownhtml">Nested Markdown/HTML</a></h4>
<p>Markdown and HTML can be used in the inner content, as you'd expect:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish tip &quot;_Referencing_ and &lt;i&gt;dereferencing&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
The opposite of *referencing* by using `&amp;` is *dereferencing*, which is
accomplished with the &lt;span style=&quot;color: hotpink&quot;&gt;dereference operator&lt;/span&gt;, `*`.
```
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition tip">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p><em>Referencing</em> and <i>dereferencing</i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The opposite of <em>referencing</em> by using <code>&amp;</code> is <em>dereferencing</em>, which is
accomplished with the <span style="color: hotpink">dereference operator</span>, <code>*</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you have code blocks you want to include in the content, use <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#fenced-code-blocks">tildes for the outer code fence</a>:</p>
<pre><code>~~~admonish bug
This syntax won't work in Python 3:
```python
print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
```
~~~
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition bug">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Bug</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This syntax won't work in Python 3:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="custom-styling"><a class="header" href="#custom-styling">Custom styling</a></h4>
<p>If you want to provide custom styling to a specific admonition, you can attach one or more custom classnames:</p>
<pre><code>```admonish note.custom-0.custom-1
Styled with my custom CSS class.
```
</code></pre>
<p>Will yield something like the following HTML, which you can then apply styles to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note custom-0 custom-1&quot;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
