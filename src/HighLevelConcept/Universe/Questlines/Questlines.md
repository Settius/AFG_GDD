### Cultist Questline – (3 Types of Cultists)
Although presented as all bad cultists from the start, there are actually 3+ unique types of cultists in their own areas and agenda’s which you discover as you progress.

1. **“The Forgotten Children”** Protective magic focused on purity of mind and soul. Believe in welcoming all to their church. Believe working in a group to pool resources will open doors control greater rituals and magic that can save the town
    - Led by secretive but powerful Chosen Sear building a wizard army
    - They secretly involve many in the town and visiting Healers gift the community with food and healing
        - Healing comes at a cost of mind and soul with the “healed” often drained physically but cured of their previous ailments

    - Base their believes on lost scrolls and manuscripts found within the shrines and history of Ankhoron,
        - “The Angels of Ankhoron were the perfection of humanity, leading the fate of humans against a force of dragons and leviathans”
        - “They were perfect in their ways, and rose above mortals as ascended on wings of light. They were the hand of Justice, and dedicated their lives to seeking out and purging the evil in the world.”
        - “But their reign was not to last and their numbers dwindled as 1000 year war tore the continent apart."

    - It is rumored the blood of angels lives on in certain people. The Great Sear is trying to purify this essence and regain wield to power of the Angels to fight.
    - **Plot Progression/Twist** 
        - As you defeat their forces in the sewers/mines and nearby, you find not all are human and many are ratmen or plagued zombies
        - As you close in on their hideout underground they decide to perform their final ritual to ascend the Great Sear to become an Angel
            - The town alchemist, a friends and questgiver, turns out to be a cult supporter and dies as sacrifice to the Great Sear

        - Great sear creates not an angel but a 3headed demon comprised of the Sear, Alchemist, and cult leader. 
        - The monster is incredibly powerful and near invincible, and you defeat them by pushing them down a great chasm leading deep into earth

2. **“Sisters of Witchlake”** Organized undead army of necromancers who lead raiding parties and put up traps to hunt humans and living in the area
    - Seem to be building a growing army of necromancers in the lands around town
        - They control most of the forests and graveyards
        - And they raid the farms to destroy what little food we can grow

    - Led by dead soldiers and farmers a like, they have made a mission of corrupting all the graves in the wartorn valley and creating a new undead army to take the town
        - Although their undead champion are strong, we know they cannot be defeated and will rise again until someone can take out the necromancer Witches that live in the center of the lake

    - They are the protectors of the Bishop King that once ruled the Fortress to the North
        - You will be required to cross their lands in order to reach the Fortress and the monastery where they train new witches

    - **Plot Twist** 
        - As you defeat their hideout you realize you are not fighting undead but human spellcasters that control the undead. The undead are limited in their intelligence but have been revived to protect the human Sisters that remain
            - Once a large successful family, after the wars the men had all died on the battlefield leaving little to defend themselves
            - The family gathered their resources and some Sisters once healers of light, turned to darkness and raised an army of undead to protect the few that remain and gather food from farms
            - Their champions are actually fallen family, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers that once died to protect their family, now continue their fight as undead champions
            - They

3. **“Nameless Devourer”** A secretive dark society of mages and necromancers that have resorted to forbidden magic. Also known as the Servants as all are devoted to serving the Devourer.
    - Magic has many schools in Ankhoron, there are darker magics but the only magics that are banned are the Abyssal magics
        - Magics that require sacrificing living creatures or human blood are frowned upon
        - But Abyssal magics generally require devotion of mind, body, and soul to dark demons. These magicks are known to be powerful but temporary.
            - Practitioners deform their bodies becoming more demonic with each use of their powers, and eventually end up losing control of their body and become a full outright demon
            - Only the hopeless and homeless resort to such magics. The Dark Lords of the Devourer often seek out the weak or dieing who may, as a last resort or in a fit of revenge, sell their soul to serve eternity as a demon rather than die as a beggar

    - The Devourers first weapon of choice is generally the Ashen Plague
        - An ancient plague created by dark magic to weaken and corrupt all living things
        - Spread by the secret cultists, they summon plague and darkness wherever they go to corrupt the crops and weak people
            - The first sign is often the smells and corruption in the sewers and caves nearby where they spread their dark rituals and plague shrines
            - Another sign is often the devouring mimics. Large - spiderlike creatures that protect the dark spells that feed the plague

        - These dark Shrines corrupt the universe itself and will bring even the greatest kingdoms to their knees as famine, drought, entropy, and endless bad luck destroy all
        - Only when their prey is sufficiently weak do they march with their great monstrous armies of undead and demons.
            - Their empire grows endlessly to the North
            - Each year acquiring new territory
            - Although Ashridge won the Dark War, they are losing the town, and it is only a matter of time before they invade again

    - **Plot Progression** 
        - Defeat of the Devourer Cultist requires discovery and cleaning out all the evil shrines in the area
            - Mimic layers, trapped shrines, and hidden magic is everywhere
            - Devourers can corrupt anyone and anything. They have cultists humans, demons, ratmen, undead, and dark champions to defend their shrines
            - Early quests involve clearing the sewers of Dark Shrines guarded
            
        - Eventually the source of the plague will lead you upstream to the Monastery Fortress where the Bishop King and the monk of monastery must be defeated as their corruption runs the deepest
            - Defeat of them will bring you to the original roots and deep catacombs which lead back to the Great Mines of beneath the city

### “Ancient Ratmen” Questline – The survivors of the Dark Age
Most think of the Ratmen as mutated rats that escaped a mad wizards experiment. But their roots run deeper than this. They are the survivors of a darker age over 1000 years ago. Once human, they are the ancestors of men who once lived with the Dragons and Leviathons of the world.
- Driven underground by the monsters in the air and in the sea, the learned to build civilizations underground and discovered the first magics 
    - Now this lives on as Shamanistic magic and Blood Magics

- When the age of Dragons ended, they saw a new age of exploration and began to meet the new people from far away and build cities above ground
    - But then came the Angelic Crusades that wiped out many civilizations under 1000 years of war
    - Those lucky enough locked themselves deep in the caves below where the humans feared to follow
    - But the Crusader kings were not kind, and they waged a war of poisons, magical plagues, and endless disease onto those below and locking the gates to cities below as they those below to die 
    - Through 1000 years, they survived, but barely as they learned to adapt by magical mutations (perhaps aided by the plague) to evolve resistance to poison, plagues, and Disease
    - With this they created great mutants like the Great Mole Giants that can dig through stone and vicious Nightmare Guards gifted with amazing speed and dexterity
        - To enhance their numbers they evolved rats into giant rats vermin to bolster their number and further their cause

- Eventually they were ready and they waged a war on the Angels
    - Sneaking from the sewers they created the magebane weapons and giant champions to defeat the Crusading Kings
        - Once great armies with fortresses able to withstand dragons
        - The Kings instead fell to a overwhelming force from below as the Ratmen rose to exact revenge on those that had trapped them a millenia
        - And as quickly as they came, they took their treasure and went back to their underground cities where they were more comfortable

    - The people that remained learned their lesson and feared the wrath of the demon rats with red eyes, blood magic, and tails of destruction
    - Quickly people sealed their sewers with great gates, closed their mines and vowed never to let the demons rise again
    - But in time this was forgotten. The keys to the gates were lots.
        - But hate for rats and ratmen ran deep, and few cities left their sewers unguarded

- In Ashridge, the Ratmen are some of the most common enemies
    - They live in the sewers, the forests, the mines and the caves
    - Most are just ratmen trying to scrape together a living and may have some Shamanistic magic
    - The true Ratmen live deep below

- **Plot Progression and role**
    - Secretive in their movements, they are well adapted and smaller ratmen are able to bypass the Great Gates that block the tunnels into the Abyss
        - They can talk and trade and some have actively traded with humans for a millenia with the shady dealers willing to work with the unseen below
    
    - Early on corrupted Ratmen are common near the Dark Shrines
        - Ratmen Bosses and Champions will protect the larger shrines will often work with other corrupted cultists (identified by possessed white eyes)
        - Scar the Ravager is a corrupted Nightmare rat
        - Fatrat the King – is a fat corrupted Molerat that leads the sewer colonies
    
    - Along he journey, the player will often encounter tips and whispers from the Ratmen that follow him
        - These will become dark allies that guide you unknowingly through the tunnels and supply you with food, water, and healing like a guardian angel

    - **Ancient Druids** - Going deeper into the Mines, Forests, and Abyss will encounter the Ancients Druids, the last of the Ancient Ratmen who live on near the surface
        - Many of the Forests and cavescontrol areas controlled by treants and the Druids
            - They will definitely be encountered as a faction neither cultist nor undead

        - Druidic magic is neither good nor evil by itself. They are the masters of natural magic that controls life and death
            - They look as druids do, generally human but unusually close with nature taking on aspects of their natural affinity whether it be rats or trees

        - Those that stray too far from the way of the Ancient Druids are known generally as Dark Druids who prefer to spread disease and rot
            - Just as humans, there are good and evil Druids among their society who are shunned by the Ancient Druids

        - Druids often retain the ability to shapeshift into trees, ratmen, and other monsters such as Mimics
            - True druids study all the natural forms but generally can only master one or 2 alternate forms, the rest are at best imitations

        - These Druids will hinder and help you along your quests
            - Side quests will allow you to pass dangerous Dark Druid lands as long as you ally yourself with the Ancient Druids

    - **Abyssal Ratmen** – they will not be encountered but its known not long after the Angelic Crusades, they disappeared with their gold and captives
        - Few ventured that deep but corruption and Devourer cultists seem more common below and above ground
        - Its hinted the cities still survive but with few details of exactly what or where
