#### Zombie Lore

1. The **Goshilos (Hungry dead)** are corpses that have been reanimated by the magical storm which has covered the wasteland. Some of these corpses were simply animated as they were while others died with more of the storm in their bloodstream and were completely overtaken by its power. The souls of the Goshilos are trapped within their rotting forms, aware but unable to do anything but submit to the will of the magic that animates them. All they know is an endless hunger and a relentless will to destroy anything not like them. Unless they are stopped they will spread their poison out of the wasteland and across the world.

2. **Jotas (Virals) “The Sickness”** These corpses laid still in their graves until the storm came and summoned them up from the ground. As the howling winds crossed the land it was joined by the moans and rattling breath of these hungry ghouls. The people of the wasteland saw to their horror that it was not just fresh bodies which rose, but older corpses which should have been little more than dust and bone. The magic of the storm gave them flesh again, and enough of a mind to find the living and devour them. They may be little more than puppets, but they know enough to find their prey and wield simple weapons against them. Since their bodies are held together by the storm itself, fire is best to keep them from rising again. Even the tiniest piece may soon grow back into another Jota.

3. **Duersos (Leapers) “The Starving”** Many Goshilos were alive when the storm hit and some died in the process of wondrous transformations. The most numerous of these are The Starving. The storm gave them great speed and agility, and razor sharp claws to tear the living apart. Once they had received these great powers they died almost instantly, starving to death trying to feed their new abilities. They returned from death just as hungry as when they crossed over. They are much faster than Jotas and will immediately attack anyone that gets close enough to them. While they are faster and more deadly than their lesser counterparts, they will quickly starve if not fed a steady diet of living flesh, but even the smallest amount of blood will send them scrambling for more.

4. **Apoyas (Toads) “The Vile”** Water is scarce in the wasteland, and what is left as become a toxic, chemical stew that has bubbled to the surface in stagnant, stinky pools, overflowing onto the sand and soaking it in poisonous muck. Anyone that died in these pools has been transformed in their resurrection into Apoyas. Mostly content to sit and eat those that walk by, the apoyas have a long, barbed tongue which can pump the victim full of the toxic sludge that bloats their body. Once the victim has been immobilized by the poison, the Apoya is free to eat. They crawl on their victim and begin to suck the liquifying insides out of the body through their tongues. Sometimes they may eat more than their distended bodies can hold and will burst, spreading their poison far in the process. 

5. **Undeza (Goons) “The Many”** Some who died in the storm died in the process of transforming into great beasts, and when they grew, anyone around them was absorbed into their new body, drowning in the flesh of the newly created Undeza. The flesh of these monsters is constantly roiling as limbs press outward, trying to escape their imprisonment inside. The Undeza are the least hungry of all Goshilos, however, they are filled with a hatred that cannot be sated. They will kill without eating, and tear their victims apart for the joy of it. Rumors abound that some Undeza speak, and may even have thoughts… Any who face them may soon be added to the multitude within, where they will beg for release for the entirety of their death.

- **Deadly Hunter** are known for their quickness and stealth as they rain death from afar with magic projectiles 

- **Arcane Blademaster** learned long ago that magic alone is weak, mastering the blade brings strength to the transient nature of the magic 

- **Elemental Barbarian** are not burdened by the weight of armor but wield the elements to protect themselves and wreck destruction on their enemies

- **Dark Druids** can expect to have access powerful monstrous abilities to defeat the game in an entirely new approach to ARPG and Fighting Game PVP.
